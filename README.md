# Book History

A small Angular application which displays the history of changes of book entities.

Uses MariaDB as the Database.

## Original task description (for reference)

Create a web front-end in Angular that displays the history of changes of book entities with pagination, filtering, ordering and optionally grouping.

The book entity should have 
* An id
* A title
* A short description
* Publish date
* Authors

An example of changes could be a title was changed, an author was added, etc.
In the list of changes it should display at least the time of change and a description of what was changed (e.g. Title was changed to “The Hobbit”)
